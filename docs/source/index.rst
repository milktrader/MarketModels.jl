MarketModels Overview
=====================

The MarketModels package aims to create robust models of markets. The data points that are used to create these models are the
period returns. These returns are used to fit a distribution to a specific market. Given the fat-tail nature of many financial
market returns, it is important to view these distributions as a mixture of several different distributions rather than a monolithic
distribution.
